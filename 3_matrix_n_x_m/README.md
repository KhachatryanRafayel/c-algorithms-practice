# n x m matrix operations

## Problems

Given are natural numbers n and m, and a matrix containing n√óm elements. Develop programs in C language to solve the following problems using pointers without applying indices:

1.  **Sum of Rows and Columns with Max Element**
    Calculate and print the sum of elements for all rows and columns that contain the largest element in the matrix.

2.  **Column with Smallest Product**
    Find and print the index of the column whose elements have the smallest product.

3.  **Min of Column Maxima**
    Find the smallest value among the largest elements of each column.

4.  **Rows with Distinct Elements**
    Find and print the indices of all rows where every element is unique. Prints "NO" if no such row exists.

5.  **Saddle Point**
    Find and print the element that is the largest in its row and the smallest in its column. Prints "NO" if no such element exists.

6.  **Remove Negative Columns**
    Remove all columns that contain **only** negative elements. The matrix remains unchanged if no such columns are found.

# Tasks on C
Here you can find algorithmic tasks I solved during the "Programming in C" course at university.
All tasks are grouped by topic, each folder contains:
- Topic desctiзtion
- Task formulations
- Solutions

## Repository Structure
- Each topic has its own folder (e.g., `Strings`, `Matrix`).  
- Inside a topic folder:
  - `README.md` — contains the **topic description** and **task formulations**.
  - Numbered solution files: `1.c`, `2.c`, ..., `N.c` (each corresponds to a task in `README.md`).

## Topics:
1. **Strings (5)** — basic string manipulation (without standard libraries).
2. **Structures (4)** — working with structs and file I/O.
3. **Matrix (n × m) (6)** — operations on rectangular matrices.
4. **Matrix (n × n) (4)** — specialized problems for square matrices.
5. **Strings with Libraries (10)** — solutions using `<string.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`.
6. **Functions (10)** — exercises on function implementation.

# Strings

1. Anagram Check
Given two words S and T, check and print TRUE if one is an anagram of the other. Otherwise, print FALSE.
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word (e.g., "listen" and "silent").

2. Reverse Letters in Words
Given a sentence in string T, reverse the letters in each word (but keep the word order the same).  
Example:  
Input: "Hello world"  
Output: "olleH dlrow"  

3. Find Palindromic Words
Given a sentence in string T, find and print all words that read the same forwards and backwards (palindromes).  
Example:  
Input: "madam knows level radar"  
Output: "madam", "level", "radar"  

5. Trim and Normalize Spaces
Given a sentence in string T, remove extra spaces from the start and end, and ensure only one space between words.  
Example:  
Input: " Hello world "  
Output: "Hello world"  

6. Words with Most Vowels
Given a sentence in string T, find and print the word(s) that contain the highest number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).  
Example:  
Input: "Apple is a fruit with juice"  
Output: "juice" (since it has the most vowels: u, i, e)

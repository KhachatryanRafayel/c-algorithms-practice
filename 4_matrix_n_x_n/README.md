# Square Matrix Operations

## Problems

Given a natural number n and a square matrix containing n√ón elements. Develop programs in C language to solve the following problems using pointers without applying indices:

1.  Calculate the value of the largest element located below the main diagonal.

2.  Calculate the value of the smallest element located above the anti-diagonal.

3.  Form a vector X by sequentially recording the elements of the matrix rows whose main diagonal element is equal to 0.

4. Form a vector X by sequentially recording the elements of the matrix columns whose anti-diagonal element is equal to 0.

Given a natural number o and a one-dimensional array X containing o elements, write programs to solve the given problems that will calculate and print

5. the number of elements of a set that have no equal elements in that set.
   
6. the sum of the elements of a set that have at least one equal element in that set.
